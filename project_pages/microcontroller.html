      <h2> RyDuino Microcontroller </h2>

      <p>
      After using many different microcontrollers through the years, Iâ€™ve developed two microcontroller boards based on my own personal preferences and experiences. Specifically, many of the major features are designed to replace things that I commonly have to use breadboards for.
      Currently, they are both based on the ATmega328P in a DIP package because I like the option of replacing chips if they get damaged. However, I plan on making another version based on the ESP32 chip.
      </p>

      <h3> Version 1 </h3>

      <p>My first version with these following features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>High current 1.5A voltage regulator, compared to 0.5A on many other controllers</li>
        <li>Screw terminal for power input to make it easier to plug in different connections</li>
        <li>Built-in 3.3V and 5V output voltage switchers for 3 pins since this is something that I commonly build on breadboards</li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Version 2 </h3>

      <p>My second, upgraded version with these following features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Micro USB connection with FTDI for USB to Serial conversion</li>
        <li>Built-in 5 pin power rails since this is something that I commonly use breadboards for</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Can supply both 5V and 3.3V</li>
          </ul>
        <li>High current 1.5A voltage regulator, compared to 0.5A on many other controllers</li>
        <li>Screw terminal for power input to make it easier to plug in different connections</li>
        <li>Built-in 3.3V and 5V output voltage switchers for 2 pins since this is something that I commonly build on breadboards</li>
      </ul>
