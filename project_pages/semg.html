      <h2> Prosthetics sEMG Signal Acquisition Board </h2>

      <p>
        This is a printed circuit board I designed, programmed, and tested during my internship at Invictus BCI that acquires surface electromyography (sEMG)
        signals to be used to control prosthetics.
        It can read from 8 channels and transmit the data wirelessly over Bluetooth. It is designed to be worn as an armband.
        <br>
        In addition to designing this main circuit board, I was the project lead of the sEMG armband team, leading a team of 3. The other members worked on the
        armband housing, signal processing software, and research into electrode materials.
      </p>

      <h2> Pictures & Video </h2>

      <h3> Version 2 Board </h3>
      <p>
        This is the current version of the board that can read 8 sEMG channels. Also pictured is an electrode.

      <h3> Version 1 Board </h3>
      <p>
        This is the first version, which is nearly identical to Version 2, except it can only read 2 instead of 8 channels.

        This is a video of a test of the device reading just the Ring Finger. As can be seen, it picks up no other finger except the Ring Finger.
