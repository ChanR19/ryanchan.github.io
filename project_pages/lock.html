      <h2> Gesture Controlled Lock </h2>

      <p>
        The Hand Gesture Door Opener allows users to open a garage door using only hand signals without physically touching anything. It is like a keypad lock that replaces pressing buttons with touch-less gestures. This is especially important now during the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic when touching objects is discouraged.

        <br><br>In addition to being a touch-less alternative to keypad locks, it has other of applications. For example, it works well in situations where the user locks themselves out without a key or phone, needs to let many people in, and, in general, is a reliable and simple way to get into a home.

        <br><br>It is also extremely easy to install. The user just needs to stick it behind a window near the garage and plug it in. Since the device is completely indoors, the user also does not have to worry about the device being tampered with or failing due to the weather, such as extreme heat, cold, or humidity. This is made possible with the Pyroelectric Infrared Sensor's ability to see through glass.

        <br><br>We chose to use a garage door opener here because it does not require any major home modifications. However, it can easily be retrofitted into other door locks.

        <br><br>The hand gestures are quite simple. The first thing the user needs to do is to wake up the device by waving their hand in front of the right sensor. After this, they can give the hand signals to open the garage door. A swipe is a "1" while a single hand over the left sensor is a "0." If the entered binary code matches the code saved in the device, the device will open the door.

        <br><br>If the device is not used for a certain period of time, it will enter sleep mode. In sleep mode, it will turn off the LCD, reset the entered values, and will allow the user to change the code to open the door using Bluetooth.

        <br><br>Changing this code to open the door is simple and the procedure can be found on step 10 of the instructions. This door code is saved to the Arduino's EEPROM, so the device will maintain the same door code even in the event of a power outage.
