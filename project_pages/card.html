      <h2> Tic-Tac-Toe on a Business Card </h2>

      <p>
        PCB business cards have always fascinated me, so I’ve decided to design my own card that plays tic-tac-toe for the upcoming application season.
        <br><br>
        There are 18 LED lights on the board, where each position on the tic-tac-toe grid has 2 lights: a blue one to mark X and a red one to mark O.
        There is also a button that you use to place your mark on the tic-tac-toe board. Your current position is marked by a blinking LED and pressing the
        button quickly will move you to a new position. Once you’re at the desired position, you hold the button to place your mark and the turn moves
        to the other player. An ATmega328P microcontroller is used to control all this logic.
      </p>

      <h3> Progress </h3>

      <p>
        This project is still in progress. Currently, I've finished the PCB design and plan to place the PCB order soon. I am also currently writing the software.
