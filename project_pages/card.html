      <h2> Tic-Tac-Toe on a Business Card </h2>

      <p>
        PCB business cards have always fascinated me, so I’ve decided to design my own card that plays tic-tac-toe for the upcoming job and internship application season.
        <br><br>
        There are 18 LED lights on the board, where each position on the tic-tac-toe grid has 2 lights: a blue one for player one and a red one for plater two.
        There is also a button that you use to place your mark on the tic-tac-toe board. Your current position is marked by a blinking LED and pressing the
        button quickly will move you to a new position. Once you’re at the desired position, you hold the button to place your mark and the turn moves
        to the other player. The first player to get three marks in a row wins. An ATmega328P microcontroller is used to control all this logic.

      <h3> Progress </h3>

      <p>
        This project is still in progress. The first prototype is finished and there is a demo above.
        However, one segment does not work due to a design error, but the new design is currently being
        produced. The USB port also still has to be soldered on.
