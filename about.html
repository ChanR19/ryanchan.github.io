      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Ryan Chan, a student at Cornell University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering <br>
        and minoring in Computer Science. Iâ€™d describe myself as a very self-motivated person - In my free time I love <br>
        teaching myself new things and doing personal projects related to those interests, like the many projects on this <br>
        website.
